# Solar-Irradiation-Forecasting
•The project aims to enhance the accuracy of solar irradiation and to uncover distinct patterns in
the data by applying clustering algorithms.
•The accuracy of the model is calculated using metrics like MSE,RMSE & R-Squared.

•K-means++ is used for clustering and SVR is used for prediction.
